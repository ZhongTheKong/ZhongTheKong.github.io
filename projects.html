      <h2> Debugging Space Invaders Tutorial </h2>
      <p> After following a tutorial on how to make Space Invaders in Godot by Cyber Potato, I noticed a bug where the player
        could be allowed to shoot if a bullet shot before death was destroyed after death. Fixing this bug demonstrated that 
        I understood the logic of the code. The link to the tutorial is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mum_l7HY4yE
