      <h2> Welcome </h2>
      <p> Welcome to my portfolio website! This website serves as both a demonstration of my HTML, CSS, JS, and overall website 
        design skill as well as a showcase of various projects and accomplishments that I am proud of. </p>

      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> As of Fall 2024, I am an undergraduate student in Clemson University. I am a senior majoring in Computer Science 
        minoring in Digital Production Arts. My interest for computer science comes from my proficiency in mathematics and 
        my childhood of playing video games. I find that computer science is a field that takes the problem solving parts of 
        math and the rewarding parts of video games and combines them to create a learning experience which truly creates a 
        push towards creativity in both logic and art.

      <h2> Debugging Space Invaders Tutorial </h2>
      <p> After following a tutorial on how to make Space Invaders in Godot by Cyber Potato, I noticed a bug where the player
        could be allowed to shoot if a bullet shot before death was destroyed after death. Fixing this bug demonstrated that 
        I understood the logic of the code. The link to the tutorial is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mum_l7HY4yE
